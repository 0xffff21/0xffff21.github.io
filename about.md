My name is Motaquillah Maddane, I’m a frontend developer, I build user interfaces as a profession and design them as a hobbie, I’m currently working for CN group.

I come from Casablanca, Morocco and I now live in Prague, Czech Republic.

My main focus right now is having a depth understanding of JavaScript, CSS, user experience and the psychology behind that.

When not doing the later, I enjoy creating/contributing to open source projects, speaking/attending local meetups and dicuss anything related to programming, books, music, life, movies, TV shows and everything in between.
